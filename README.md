## Note

This project hasn't been abandoned just yet!  During my research I came across the ATECC608A security coprocessor that's present on the USB Armory Mk. 2 rev. Î² (see: https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki/I%C2%B2C-(Mk-II))

I haven't found a usable driver for it yet, so I'm building one out as part of [G-Net](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net).  This project will continue to be updated as needed to support USB Armory Mk. 2 compatibility in G-Net.
